# Implementation of the Bᴀsᴀʟᴛ algorithm simulation

This package contains a Rust program that simulates a very large network of nodes runing the Bᴀsᴀʟᴛ random peer sampling algorithm.
The only requirements to run this simulation is a working Rust installation.

See `example.sh` for example command line invocations.
Call `cargo run -- --help` to get more information on command line arguments and their meaning.
